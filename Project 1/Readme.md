MySQL Project: Record Company Database
Welcome to my first MySQL project! This project is based on a record company database that I designed and
implemented using MySQL. The database contains tables for bands, albums, and songs, and it's intended 
to provide a comprehensive view of the record company's catalog.

In this project, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in database design, as well as my ability to use MySQL 
to query and manipulate data. Specifically, I have created a database schema that represents the various relationships 
between bands, albums, and songs, and I have populated it with sample data to simulate a real-world scenario.

Throughout the project, I have used a variety of SQL statements and functions to retrieve and filter data, including 
SELECT, FROM, JOIN, WHERE, ORDER BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG and MAX. 

Overall, this project has allowed me to apply my knowledge of SQL and database design to a real-world scenario, and has 
helped me to develop a deeper understanding of how data can be organized and queried efficiently. 
I hope you find it informative and enjoyable to explore!
