This SQL portfolio reflects my ongoing journey in learning SQL, particularly focusing on MySQL. It showcases the projects that 
I have undertaken as part of my learning process, highlighting the new skills and techniques I have acquired along the way.

If you are interested in discussing my projects or giving feedback feel free to reach me. 

Thank you for visiting my MySQL portfolio!
